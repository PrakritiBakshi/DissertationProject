        The multi-billion dollar fairness cream industry in India sells fairness
        as a prerequisite for beauty, confidence, and success. While there is
        the direct correlation of British companies like Hindustan Unilever
        profiting off of an industry that exemplifies colourism, the need for
        such an industry has colonial antecedents itself. Although a
        colour-based power imbalance existed before colonial rule, there is
        little evidence to show that discrimination was metted out solely due to
        skin colour. The underlying reason was caste—a hierarchical system in
        society that demarcated clear division of labour. With lower caste
        persons working in the sun for long durations and having lesser economic
        and social capital, society remained further stratified on the basis of
        colour, caste, and class. India’s reverence for lighter skin was
        exacerbated with the arrival of imperial rule. As the British
        strengthened their position, power’s association with lighter skin
        strengthened.

        The murder of George Floyd on 25 May 2020 and the subsequent Black Lives
        Matter (BLM) protests around the globe renewed the discourse on racism.
        Many Bollywood celebrities were called out for their hypocrisy of
        speaking out against racism in a time of global protest while promoting
        skin lightening products back home. The resulting backlash led to
        companies rushing to rebrand their fairness products in June 2020. The
        biggest names in the market began company wide rebranding without
        addressing the prevalence of colourism. Overnight, ‘fair’ became ‘glow’
        and ‘white’ became ‘bright’. The rebranding seems to be merely
        skin-deep.

      <p>
        Two years on, have the companies really stopped using the words ‘fair’
        and ‘white’? Is it enough? With the products still on shelves and the
        industry still profitable, has anything really changed apart from the
        codification of certain words to mean fair?

        <b>An analysis in 4 charts</b>
      </div>

      <p>
        We looked at 500 skin cream search results on Amazon to see if they are
        still using the words ‘fair’ and/or ‘white’. The results were derived
        from 4 keywords that are alternatives for fairness creams: Lightening
        cream, Brightening cream, Illuminating cream, and Glow cream.

        The results reveal that despite promises by many skin cream brands to
        shift to stop using the words ‘fair’ and ‘white’ 30% of the skin
        products still used them to describe their products. Despite promises of
        diversity, nearly 60% of skin products had light skin models in their
        advertisements. Reviews and questions on these Amazon results illustrate
        the gravity of the situation and just how deep-seated colourism is. On a
        product listing of a fairness cream that had stopped calling itself a
        fairness cream, an anonymous user had asked on 15th July 2022 if the
        product was good for her 13 year old daughter who had dark skin. A user
        of one of the radiance creams complained that they were still the same
        shade despite using the product regularly for 2 months. The anecdotes go
        on.

      <p>
        Matrimonial advertisements boasting and requesting fairness reflect the
        way people think in our society. The influence is not from the platform
        hosting the classified advertisements but from the people. With fairness
        cream advertisements it's a perpetual cycle that needs disruption.
      </p>
      
    <p>
      This is a problem that needs more from the industry than thesaurus fuelled rebranding.
