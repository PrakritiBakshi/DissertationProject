        Within hours of Queen Elizabeth II’s death in September, Indian Twitter
        was talking about the Kohinoor: one of the largest cut diamonds in the
        world that was mined in India and which is now part of the Crown Jewels.
      </p>
      <p>
        The diamond was last in the news in 2016, when India’s Supreme Court
        ruled that the country had no claim to the diamond since it had not been
        taken by force. When the British Prime Minister David Cameron was asked
        about it on his 2010 tour of India, he said “If you say yes to one, you
        suddenly find the British Museum would be empty.” This is the floodgates
        argument against restitution which implies that returning one contested
        object would set precedent for a deluge of other claims.
      </p>
      <p>
        But in August the first repatriation of objects to India from the UK
        took place, when seven antiquities were handed over — not by the British
        Museum, but by Glasgow Life Museums.
      </p>
      <p>
        India has only ever made one valid official request to the British
        Museum for the repatriation of cultural treasures: when the state of
        Andhra Pradesh asked for the Amaravati Marbles, in 2015.
      </p>
      <p>The request appears to be without response.</p>
      <div>
        <b>What are the Amaravati Marbles?</b>
      </div>
      <p>
        When the East India Company annexed the Guntur District of modern day
        Andhra Pradesh in the late 1780s, it set into motion a series of events
        that led to the discovery, dismemberment, and eventual display of a 2nd
        century Buddhist stupa at the British Museum. The Amaravati Marbles are
        a collection of about 121 intricately carved sculptures and narrative
        relief panels that made up a significant portion of the stupa – a dome
        edifice used for the veneration of saints and relics. This collection
        only forms part of the structure with remnants of the shrine in over 20
        museums across the world. They are also known as the Elliot Marbles
        owing to their association with Sir Walter Elliot, a Scottish civil
        servant of the Madras Presidency, who oversaw a significant period of
        excavation in 1845. The sculptures are figurative and depict the
        Buddhist Jataka tales.

        The stupa at Amaravati, known as the Mahachaitya or Great Shrine, was
        one of the most revered Buddhist sites of ancient India. While Buddhism
        entered a gradual state of decline in south-east India around the 4th
        century, Amaravati held its esteem as late as the 14th century. As it
        fell into disuse, this monument of ornate stone carvings was obscured
        from sight for 400 years. The history of its modern discovery is marked
        by a series of disparate excavations; some by locals for building
        material, others by colonial surveyors with varying degrees of
        excavation skills, often in search of treasure to ship off to private or
        museum collections.

      <p>
        Historian Upinder Singh summarises the shrine’s fate in her article
        Amaravati: the dismembering of the Mahācaitya. She says, “the result of
        a century and three-quarters of explorations and excavations at
        Amaravati is that today, the site of one of the greatest mahacaityas of
        ancient India is marked by a nondescript mound ringed by a few forlorn
        stones.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The shrine was discovered by a local landlord in 1798 and first
        documented by Colonel Colin Mackenzie, a military engineer and surveyor.
        It took about 175 years for these priceless pieces to be safely and
        respectfully exhibited. During this time the pieces have been
        refashioned as monuments, carted off to private collections with
        suboptimal conditions, left out on lawns, stuck to the outer walls of
        museums, left to languish in stables and packed up for years in
        basements. The graphic below traces the journey of 121 pieces of the
        stupa through layers of decisions, processes, and attempts at
        documentation, to their eventual exhibition at the British Museum.

        The Elliot Marbles in the British Museum are not marble, but limestone.
        Sir Walter Elliot was neither the architect nor discoverer of the
        ancient Buddhist stupa, but one of the excavators who shipped off
        sculptures from the site. The name does, however, capture the
        controversy that comes to mind when thinking of the similar sounding but
        much renowned Elgin Marbles from ancient Greece. The Amaravati
        Collection, as is the more precise description, has had a tumultuous
        journey from the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh to its current resting
        place in room 33A of the British Museum. The marbles are described by
        the museum as, “the single most important group of Indian sculptures
        outside the subcontinent.”
      </p>
      <p>The state government of Andhra Pradesh now wants them back.</p>
      <div>
        <b> Requests and their status</b>
      </div>
      <p>
        A Freedom of Information request was sent to the British Museum in July
        to investigate how many requests for repatriation were made by India
        since the year 2000. Although the debate, demands and diplomatic quips
        have never died down, only one valid request was filed from India. The
        Museum responded that two additional requests were received from India
        for items not in possession of the museum. The first request in 2003 by
        the Bharatiya Janata Party of Madhya Pradesh misidentified the Ambika
        statue as the Saraswati statue invalidating the claim. The second
        request in 2018 was by the High Commission of India for objects
        associated with Rani Chennamma, but these were not held by the British
        Museum.
      </p>
      <p>
        The one credible request for the Amaravati sculptures seems to be a
        one-man mission rather than strategic national policy. In 2015,
        Veeranjaneyulu Jasti, the chairman of the Amaravati Development
        Authority wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging the
        Centre to take necessary steps to bring back the Amaravati Collection
        from London. The same year he’d also written a letter to Tamil Nadu
        Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa seeking the return of hundreds of
        Amaravati sculptures housed at the National Museum at Chennai. The
        artefacts had been shipped to erstwhile Madras by the British during
        colonial rule. Mr. Jasti seemed to be the person behind this mission.
        While the Tamil Nadu government agreed to return the objects, the
        question of the Amaravati Marbles is shrouded in silence. There has been
        no known response nor follow-up.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Andhra Pradesh government has ambitious plans for the city of
        Amaravati which was made the new capital of Andhra Pradesh in 2015. An
        integral part of this plan was to make the city a tourist hub by
        bringing back lost cultural heritage by establishing a ‘Monastery
        Boulevard’ – a place of solace for Buddhists from across the world. It
        has been 7 years since the request was filed and now the trail has gone
        cold.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seven months before this repatriation request was filed, the Indian
        media and public were lambasting the solicitor general’s comments in the
        Supreme Court that renounced any claim India had to the Kohinoor. In
        response, the government declared its intention to make all possible
        efforts to bring back the gem in an amicable way. The ministers of
        foreign affairs and culture were consulted to discuss potential
        strategies and one of the options was to reportedly relinquish all
        rights to artefacts in possession of the UK for return of the Kohinoor.
        This would include the Amaravati Marbles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even with fresh instances of repatriation, the Kohinoor back in the
        news, and renewed talk on colonialism, the Amaravati Marbles failed to
        reach headlines with no new spokesperson for their case.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prashant Reddy Thikkavarapu summarises the need of the hour in his
        article A Rock and a Hard Place published in The Caravan; “If India is
        to recover the Kohinoor or anything else, what the country needs is not
        a quick compromise of the kind the government considered, but rather a
        long-term diplomatic strategy that expressly links demands for
        restitution to the immorality of colonialism.” he says. The article was
        published 7 years ago and still holds. Even in the recent fervour on the
        Kohinoor, no strategic long-term plan was proposed from either side of
        the table to address the injustices of the colonial era.

        <b>Precedent for return</b>
      </div>
      <p>
        The British Museum owns 8 million objects of which only 1% are on
        permanent display. The collection from pre-independent India comprises
        65,336 objects. That, however, does not mean that all of these objects
        are looted artefacts. Nor do they all have the cultural and religious
        value that the Amaravati Marbles do. Therefore, those in favour of
        restitution maintain that objects that have been contested or have had a
        tumultuous history should be acknowledged without the fear of the
        floodgates argument.
      </p>
      <p>
        The UK maintains that India has no legal claim over objects taken into
        possession during colonial rule. Looking at the country’s position in
        history, the Allied governments issued the Inter-Allied Declaration
        Against Acts of Dispossession Committed in Territories Under Enemy
        Occupation or Control in 1943. This stated their intent to invalidate
        any transfer of property regardless of their “legality”. The default
        stance was that transfer of property in occupied territory was under
        duress. The declaration holds “whether transfers or dealings have taken
        the form of open looting or plunder, or of transactions apparently legal
        in form, even when they purport to be voluntarily effected." The
        principle on which this declaration stands is that property taken under
        coercive circumstances should be returned to their country of origin.
        The baseline is whether or not the UK admits the illegality or colonial
        rule.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is not that the UK does not believe in restitution. The Holocaust
        (Return of Cultural Objects) Act 2009 that allows the deaccession by
        museums and the return of cultural objects acquired during the Nazi era
        to their rightful owners was renwed indefinitely in 2019. The British
        Museum also has a carefully drafted repatriation policy for human
        remains. However, there is no law for the repatriation of loot that had
        come to the UK from its former colonies.
      </p>
      <p>
        The repatriation discourse was reignited in 2020 when President Emmanual
        Macron promised to return all African artefacts acquired from colonies
        of the French empire. The trend has led to the first restitution made by
        the UK to India. Six of the seven items returned by Glasgow Museums were
        forcibly taken from temples in North India and the seventh, a sword, was
        looted in 1905 from the collection of the ruler of Hyderabad. The items
        were gifted to the Scotland museums and have now found their way home a
        century later. The Amaravati Marbles await a similar fate.
