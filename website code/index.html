      <h1>The Lingering Effects of British Colonialism on India</h1>
    </div>

      <p>
        With the passing of Queen Elizabeth II, the era of the longest reigning
        British monarch has ended and with that has come questions about legacy,
        grief, and colonialism. While colonial history is seen as just
        that—history—for a lot of the world its effects never dissipated
        completely.
      </p>
      <p>
        In India, a complex relationship exists with the monarchy’s
        institutional existence as the country attempts to reconcile with the
        past. This was elucidated by the fact that a national day of mourning
        was held for the Queen hours after Rajpath (a road in New Delhi that
        once honoured King George V) was renamed in an attempt to decolonise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the lingering remnants of colonisation are tangible and can be
        measured. They are visible in the form of museum displays and the names
        of roads, but 200 years of colonial rule has also manifested in the form
        of deep-seated behaviours that still exist today. This project looks at
        two disparate themes, one from each end of the tangibility spectrum,
        that saw new developments and discussion unfurl in the past few years:
        a) the repatriation of artefacts to their countries of origin and b) the
        perpetuation of colourism through the fairness cream industry.

        2022 is the year the United Kingdom celebrated the Queen’s Platinum
        Jubilee. It is also the year India celebrated 75 years of being an
        independent nation. And for both these historical celebrations I was
        studying in the land that colonised my ancestors.
      </p>
      <p>
        While one country was celebrating the reign of a monarch, the other was
        celebrating its freedom from the empire she inherited. In India the
        celebrations were called “Azaadi ka Amrit Mahotsav” which roughly
        translates to “a grand festival celebrating the elixir of freedom”. But,
        I’d often wondered how free we really were from our colonial past.
        Seventy-five years of independence from the British Raj, and there were
        still visible vestiges of imperialism seen on the country’s economy,
        culture, politics, and people.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Indians look back at 200 years of colonial subjugation, many talk
        of the looted wealth, savagery of orchestrated famine, creation of
        Hindu-Muslim antagonisms, pillaged resources, and violent suppression.
        We look at our freedom struggle and the trauma of the India-Pakistan
        partition. Yet others talk of the railways the British built, the
        proliferation of the English language, and missionary work.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ripples of the empire the Queen represented for decades continue to
        be felt in the material culture and psyche of the Indian subcontinent.
        The project’s intent was to evaluate past wrongs without absolving
        ourselves from remedying them in the present. For that reason, both
        articles focus on recent actions in India. The purpose of this two-fold
        project is to serve as follow-ups to recent debates.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first article stems from the repatriation debate – whether colonial
        era artefacts acquired by museums should be returned to their countries
        of origin. It started with a simple question: How many requests has
        India made to the British Museum for the repatriation of artefacts? The
        answer is one. The article explores this one request and the history of
        the contested artefacts at its root: 121 sculptures from Amaravati.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second article is on colourism in India – discrimination on the
        basis of skin colour. Colonialism perpetuated and exacerbated colourism
        and it continues to exist in Indian society today. When Indian
        celebrities came out in support of the global anti-racism Black Lives
        Matter (BLM) protests that erupted in May 2020, they were called out for
        their hypocrisy given that many of them have promoted skin whitening
        products in the past. The resulting backlash led to Indian companies
        rushing to rebrand their fairness products. Two years on, this project
        asks: Have skin lightening creams stopped using the words ‘fair’ and
        ‘white’ and is it enough?
