# The lingering effects of British Colonialism on India

Some of the lingering remnants of colonisation are tangible and can be measured. They are visible in the form of museum displays and the names of roads, but 200 years of colonial rule has also manifested in the form of deep-seated behaviours that still exist today. This project looks at two disparate themes, one from each end of the tangibility spectrum: a) the repatriation of artefacts to their countries of origin and b) the perpetuation of colourism through the fairness cream industry.

This repository is for Prakriti Bakshi's dissertation for MSc Computational and Data Journalism at Cardiff University. 
It contains code, data, and graphics used to produce the two articles that make up the project: 
1. The Amaravati Marbles: A story of possession and repatriation
2. The langauge of skin lightening creams in India

Although the data has been collected in a systematic way, it is still subject to human error. If you have any questions please write to me at prakritibakshi@gmail.com. You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prakriti-bakshi-data/).
